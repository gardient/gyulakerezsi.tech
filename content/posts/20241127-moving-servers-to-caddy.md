Bit of a work in progress still

I'm moving hosting providers slowly and want to set up a BlueSky PDS,
they use caddy, and I'm interested in the fact that has an api for configuration

I'll update this as I go

for now the only thing I can say: check your paths people

Got ntfy running on the server, nice and painless

I'm starting to like caddy

### EDIT 2024-11-29

Portainer and docker are running. Now to move Gitea.
