So for the first post on my blog I will tell you about my experience with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

Setup is simple enough, just follow the instructions on their get started page.
If you are on Windows I recommend installing with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

A lot less painful on Windows than Jekyl, as you don't have to mess around with installing ruby

Last time I tried to set Jekyl up I was messing around for about 3 hours, comparatively this site was about 1 hour, from deciding to set it up to this post

That's it for first post, more to come...

If I don't forget it
